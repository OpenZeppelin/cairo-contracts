= Presets

include::utils/_class_hashes.adoc[]

Presets are ready-to-deploy contracts provided by the library. Since presets are intended to be very simple
and as generic as possible, there's no support for custom or complex contracts such as `ERC20Pausable` or `ERC721Mintable`.

TIP: For contract customization and combination of modules you can use {wizard}, our code-generation tool.


## Available presets

List of available presets and their corresponding {sierra-class-hashes}.

NOTE: Class hashes were computed using {class-hash-cairo-version}.

|===
| Name | Compiled Class Hash

| `{account}`
| `{account-class-hash}`

| `{erc20}`
| `{erc20-class-hash}`

| `{erc721}`
| `{erc721-class-hash}`

TIP: {starkli} class-hash command can be used to compute the class hash from a compiled artifact.
