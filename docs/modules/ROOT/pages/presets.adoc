= Presets

include::utils/_class_hashes.adoc[]

Presets are ready-to-deploy contracts provided by the library. Since presets are intended to be very simple
and as generic as possible, there's no support for custom or complex contracts such as `ERC20Pausable` or `ERC721Mintable`.

TIP: For contract customization and combination of modules you can use {wizard}, our code-generation tool.


== Available presets

List of available presets and their corresponding {sierra-class-hashes}.

NOTE: Class hashes were computed using {class-hash-cairo-version}.

|===
| Name | Sierra Class Hash

| `{account-upgradeable}`
| `{AccountUpgradeable-class-hash}`

| `{erc20-upgradeable}`
| `{ERC20Upgradeable-class-hash}`

| `{erc721-upgradeable}`
| `{ERC721Upgradeable-class-hash}`

| `{erc1155-upgradeable}`
| `{ERC1155Upgradeable-class-hash}`

| `{eth-account-upgradeable}`
| `{EthAccountUpgradeable-class-hash}`

| `{udc}`
| `{UniversalDeployer-class-hash}`
|===

TIP: {starkli} class-hash command can be used to compute the class hash from a Sierra artifact.

== Usage

:setup_project: xref:index.adoc#set_up_your_project[setting up a project]
:install_lib: xref:index.adoc#install the_library[installing the Contracts for Cairo library]
:presets_dir: link:https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/cairo-contracts/blob/release-v0.12.0/src/presets[presets directory]

These preset contracts are ready-to-deploy which means they should already be declared on the Sepolia network.
Simply deploy the preset class hash and add the appropriate constructor arguments.
Deploying the ERC20Upgradeable preset with {starkli}, for example, will look like this:

[,bash, subs="verbatim,attributes"]
----
starkli deploy {ERC20Upgradeable-class-hash} \
  <CONSTRUCTOR_ARGS> \
  --network="sepolia"
----

If a class hash has yet to be declared, copy/paste the preset contract code and declare it locally.
Start by {setup_project} and {install_lib}.
Copy the target preset contract from the {presets_dir} and paste it in the new project's `src/lib.cairo` like this:

[,cairo]
----
// src/lib.cairo

#[starknet::contract]
mod ERC20Upgradeable {
    use openzeppelin::access::ownable::OwnableComponent;
    use openzeppelin::token::erc20::{ERC20Component, ERC20HooksEmptyImpl};
    use openzeppelin::upgrades::UpgradeableComponent;
    use openzeppelin::upgrades::interface::IUpgradeable;
    use starknet::{ContractAddress, ClassHash};

    component!(path: OwnableComponent, storage: ownable, event: OwnableEvent);
    component!(path: ERC20Component, storage: erc20, event: ERC20Event);
    component!(path: UpgradeableComponent, storage: upgradeable, event: UpgradeableEvent);

    // Ownable Mixin
    #[abi(embed_v0)]
    impl OwnableMixinImpl = OwnableComponent::OwnableMixinImpl<ContractState>;
    impl OwnableInternalImpl = OwnableComponent::InternalImpl<ContractState>;

    // ERC20 Mixin
    #[abi(embed_v0)]
    impl ERC20MixinImpl = ERC20Component::ERC20MixinImpl<ContractState>;
    impl ERC20InternalImpl = ERC20Component::InternalImpl<ContractState>;

    // Upgradeable
    impl UpgradeableInternalImpl = UpgradeableComponent::InternalImpl<ContractState>;

    #[storage]
    struct Storage {
        #[substorage(v0)]
        ownable: OwnableComponent::Storage,
        #[substorage(v0)]
        erc20: ERC20Component::Storage,
        #[substorage(v0)]
        upgradeable: UpgradeableComponent::Storage
    }

    #[event]
    #[derive(Drop, starknet::Event)]
    enum Event {
        #[flat]
        OwnableEvent: OwnableComponent::Event,
        #[flat]
        ERC20Event: ERC20Component::Event,
        #[flat]
        UpgradeableEvent: UpgradeableComponent::Event
    }

    #[constructor]
    fn constructor(
        ref self: ContractState,
        name: ByteArray,
        symbol: ByteArray,
        fixed_supply: u256,
        recipient: ContractAddress,
        owner: ContractAddress
    ) {
        self.ownable.initializer(owner);
        self.erc20.initializer(name, symbol);
        self.erc20._mint(recipient, fixed_supply);
    }

    #[abi(embed_v0)]
    impl UpgradeableImpl of IUpgradeable<ContractState> {
        fn upgrade(ref self: ContractState, new_class_hash: ClassHash) {
            self.ownable.assert_only_owner();
            self.upgradeable._upgrade(new_class_hash);
        }
    }
}
----

Next, compile the contract.

[,bash]
----
scarb build
----

Finally, declare the preset.

[,bash]
----
starkli declare target/dev/my_project_ERC20Upgradeable.contract_class.json \
  --network="sepolia"
----
