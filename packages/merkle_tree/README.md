> **NOTE:** This document is better viewed at https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts-cairo/api/introspection

This crate provides a set of utilities for verifying Merkle Tree proofs on-chain. The tree and the proofs can be
generated using this [JavaScript library](https://github.com/ericnordelo/strk-merkle-tree) both for Pedersen and Poseidon
hashing algorithms.
