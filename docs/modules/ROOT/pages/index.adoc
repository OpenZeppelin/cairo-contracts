= Contracts for Cairo

*A library for secure smart contract development* written in Cairo for {starknet}. This library consists of a set of xref:components.adoc[reusable components] to build custom smart contracts, as well as
ready-to-deploy xref:presets.adoc[presets]. You can also find other xref:/api/utilities.adoc[utilities] including xref:interfaces.adoc[interfaces and dispatchers] and xref:/api/testing.adoc[test utilities]
that facilitate testing with Starknet Foundry.

WARNING: This repo contains highly experimental code. Expect rapid iteration. *Use at your own risk.*

NOTE: You can track our roadmap and future milestones in our https://github.com/orgs/OpenZeppelin/projects/29/[Github Project].

== Installation

The library is available as a {scarb} package. Follow {installation} for installing Cairo and Scarb on your machine
before proceeding, and run the following command to check that the installation was successful:

[,bash]
----
$ scarb --version

scarb 2.12.0 (639d0a65e 2025-08-04)
cairo: 2.12.0 (https://crates.io/crates/cairo-lang-compiler/2.12.0)
sierra: 1.7.0
----

=== Set up your project

Create an empty directory, and `cd` into it:

[,bash]
----
mkdir my_project/ && cd my_project/
----

Initialize a new Scarb project:

[,bash]
----
scarb init
----

The contents of `my_project/` should now look like this:

[,bash]
----
$ ls

Scarb.toml src
----

=== Install the library

:versioning: xref:index.adoc#versioning_of_the_sub_packages[Versioning of the sub-packages]

[IMPORTANT]
====
The `openzeppelin` package is an umbrella package that includes all the packages in the library.
Before version `3.x.x`, the `openzeppelin` and its sub-packages
were versioned together meaning that the version of the `openzeppelin`
package was the same as the version of the sub-packages.

Starting from version `3.x.x`, with the introduction of the `openzeppelin_interfaces` package,
the `openzeppelin` package is versioned independently from the sub-packages.

See the {versioning} section for more information.
====

Install the library by declaring it as a dependency in the project's `Scarb.toml` file:

[,javascript]
----
[dependencies]
openzeppelin = "3.0.0-alpha.0"
----

The previous example would import the entire library. We can also add each package as a separate dependency to
improve the building time by not including modules that won't be used:

[,javascript]
----
[dependencies]
openzeppelin_access = "3.0.0-alpha.0"
openzeppelin_token = "3.0.0-alpha.0"
openzeppelin_interfaces = "1.0.0"
----

== Versioning of the sub-packages

Here you can find a reference of the versioning of the sub-packages for this umbrella version:

[,javascript]
----
[dependencies]
openzeppelin_access = "3.0.0-alpha.0"
openzeppelin_token = "3.0.0-alpha.0"
openzeppelin_access = "3.0.0-alpha.0"
openzeppelin_account = "3.0.0-alpha.0"
openzeppelin_finance = "3.0.0-alpha.0"
openzeppelin_interfaces = "1.0.0"
openzeppelin_governance = "3.0.0-alpha.0"
openzeppelin_introspection = "3.0.0-alpha.0"
openzeppelin_merkle_tree = "3.0.0-alpha.0"
openzeppelin_presets = "3.0.0-alpha.0"
openzeppelin_security = "3.0.0-alpha.0"
openzeppelin_token = "3.0.0-alpha.0"
openzeppelin_upgrades = "3.0.0-alpha.0"
openzeppelin_utils = "3.0.0-alpha.0"
----

== Basic usage

This is how it looks to build an ERC20 contract using the xref:erc20.adoc[ERC20 component].
Copy the code into `src/lib.cairo`.

[,cairo]
----
#[starknet::contract]
mod MyERC20Token {
    // NOTE: If you added the entire library as a dependency,
    // use `openzeppelin::token` instead.
    use openzeppelin_token::erc20::{ERC20Component, ERC20HooksEmptyImpl, DefaultConfig};
    use starknet::ContractAddress;

    component!(path: ERC20Component, storage: erc20, event: ERC20Event);

    // ERC20 Mixin
    #[abi(embed_v0)]
    impl ERC20MixinImpl = ERC20Component::ERC20MixinImpl<ContractState>;
    impl ERC20InternalImpl = ERC20Component::InternalImpl<ContractState>;

    #[storage]
    struct Storage {
        #[substorage(v0)]
        erc20: ERC20Component::Storage
    }

    #[event]
    #[derive(Drop, starknet::Event)]
    enum Event {
        #[flat]
        ERC20Event: ERC20Component::Event
    }

    #[constructor]
    fn constructor(
        ref self: ContractState,
        name: ByteArray,
        symbol: ByteArray,
        fixed_supply: u256,
        recipient: ContractAddress
    ) {
        self.erc20.initializer(name, symbol);
        self.erc20.mint(recipient, fixed_supply);
    }
}
----

You can now compile it:

[,bash]
----
scarb build
----
