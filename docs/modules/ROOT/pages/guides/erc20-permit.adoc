The {eip-2612} standard, commonly referred to as ERC20Permit, is designed to support gasless token approvals. This is achieved with an off-chain 
signature following the {snip-12} standard, rather than with an on-chain transaction. The {permit-fn} function verifies the signature and sets 
the spender's allowance if the signature is valid. This approach improves user experience and reduces gas costs.

== Differences from Solidity

Although this extension is mostly similar to the {permit-solidity-impl} of {eip-2612}, there are some notable differences in the parameters of the {permit-fn} function:

- The `deadline` parameter is represented by `u64` rather than `u256`.
- The `signature` parameter is represented by a span of felts rather than `v`, `r`, and `s` values.

NOTE: Unlike Solidity, there is no enforced format for signatures on Starknet. A signature is represented by an array or span of felts, 
and there is no universal method for validating signatures of unknown formats. Consequently, a signature provided to the {permit-fn} function 
is validated through an external `is_valid_signature` call to the contract at the `owner` address.

== Usage

The functionality is provided as an embeddable {erc20-permit-trait} trait of the {erc20-component}.

```cairo
#[abi(embed_v0)]
impl ERC20PermitImpl = ERC20Component::ERC20PermitImpl<ContractState>;
```

A contract must meet the following requirements to be able to use the {erc20-permit-trait} trait:

- Implement {erc20-component}.
- Implement {nonces-component}.
- Implement {snip12-metadata} trait (used in signature generation).

== Typed message

To safeguard against replay attacks and ensure the uniqueness of each approval via {permit-fn}, the data signed includes:

- The address of the `owner`.
- The parameters specified in the {approve-fn} function (`spender` and `amount`)
- The address of the `token` contract itself.
- A `nonce`, which must be unique for each operation.
- The `chain_id`, which protects against cross-chain replay attacks.

The format of the `Permit` structure in a signed permit message is as follows:
```cairo
struct Permit {
    token: ContractAddress,
    spender: ContractAddress,
    amount: u256,
    nonce: felt252,
    deadline: u64,
}
```

NOTE: The owner of the tokens is also part of the signed message. It is used as the `signer` parameter in the `get_message_hash` call.

Further details on preparing and signing a typed message can be found in the {snip-12-guide}.
