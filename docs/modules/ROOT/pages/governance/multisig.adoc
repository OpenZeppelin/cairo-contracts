= Multisig

:multisig-component: xref:api/governance.adoc#MultisigComponent[MultisigComponent]
:snip12-metadata: xref:api/utilities.adoc#snip12[SNIP12Metadata]

The Multisig component implements a multi-signature mechanism to enhance the security and 
governance of smart contract transactions. It ensures that no single signer can unilaterally 
execute critical actions, requiring multiple registered signers to approve and collectively 
execute transactions.

This component is designed to secure operations such as fund management or protocol governance, 
where collective decision-making is essential. The Multisig Component is self-administered, 
meaning that changes to signers or quorum must be approved through the multisig process itself.

== Key features

- *Multi-Signature Security*: transactions must be approved by multiple signers, ensuring 
distributed governance.

- *Quorum Enforcement*: defines the minimum number of approvals required for transaction execution.

- *Self-Administration*: all modifications to the component (e.g., adding or removing signers) 
must pass through the multisig process.

- *Event Logging*: provides comprehensive event logging for transparency and auditability.

== Signer management

The Multisig component introduces the concept of signers and quorum:

- *Signers*: only registered signers can submit, confirm, revoke, or execute transactions. The Multisig 
Component supports adding, removing, or replacing signers.
- *Quorum*: the quorum defines the minimum number of confirmations required to approve a transaction. 

NOTE: To prevent unauthorized modifications, only the contract itself can add, remove, or replace signers or change the quorum. 
This ensures that all modifications pass through the multisig approval process.

== Transaction lifecycle

The state of a transaction is represented by the `TransactionState` enum and can be retrieved 
by calling the `get_transaction_state` function with the transaction's identifier.

The identifier of a multisig transaction is a `felt252` value, computed as the Pedersen hash 
of the transaction's calls and salt. It can be computed by invoking the implementing contract's 
`hash_transaction` method for single-call transactions or `hash_transaction_batch` for multi-call 
transactions. Submitting a transaction with identical calls and the same salt value a second time 
will fail, as transaction identifiers must be unique. To resolve this, use a different salt value 
to generate a unique identifier.

A transaction in the Multisig component follows a specific lifecycle:

`NotFound` → `Pending` → `Confirmed` → `Executed`

- *NotFound*: the transaction does not exist.
- *Pending*: the transaction exists but has not reached the required confirmations.
- *Confirmed*: the transaction has reached the quorum but has not yet been executed.
- *Executed*: the transaction has been successfully executed.

== Usage

Integrating the Multisig functionality into a contract requires implementing {multisig-component}.
The contract's constructor should initialize the component with a quorum value and a list of initial signers.

Here's an example of a simple wallet contract featuring the Multisig functionality:

----
#[starknet::contract]
mod MultisigWallet {
    use openzeppelin_governance::multisig::MultisigComponent;
    use starknet::ContractAddress;

    component!(path: MultisigComponent, storage: multisig, event: MultisigEvent);

    #[abi(embed_v0)]
    impl MultisigImpl = MultisigComponent::MultisigImpl<ContractState>;
    impl MultisigInternalImpl = MultisigComponent::InternalImpl<ContractState>;

    #[storage]
    struct Storage {
        #[substorage(v0)]
        multisig: MultisigComponent::Storage,
    }

    #[event]
    #[derive(Drop, starknet::Event)]
    enum Event {
        #[flat]
        MultisigEvent: MultisigComponent::Event,
    }

    #[constructor]
    fn constructor(ref self: ContractState, quorum: u32, signers: Span<ContractAddress>) {
        self.multisig.initializer(quorum, signers);
    }
}

== Interface

This is the interface of a contract implementing the {multisig-component}:

[,cairo]
----
#[starknet::interface]
pub trait MultisigABI<TState> {
    // Read functions
    fn get_quorum(self: @TState) -> u32;
    fn is_signer(self: @TState, signer: ContractAddress) -> bool;
    fn get_signers(self: @TState) -> Span<ContractAddress>;
    fn is_confirmed(self: @TState, id: TransactionID) -> bool;
    fn is_confirmed_by(self: @TState, id: TransactionID, signer: ContractAddress) -> bool;
    fn is_executed(self: @TState, id: TransactionID) -> bool;
    fn get_submitted_block(self: @TState, id: TransactionID) -> u64;
    fn get_transaction_state(self: @TState, id: TransactionID) -> TransactionState;
    fn get_transaction_confirmations(self: @TState, id: TransactionID) -> u32;
    fn hash_transaction(
        self: @TState,
        to: ContractAddress,
        selector: felt252,
        calldata: Span<felt252>,
        salt: felt252,
    ) -> TransactionID;
    fn hash_transaction_batch(self: @TState, calls: Span<Call>, salt: felt252) -> TransactionID;

    // Write functions
    fn add_signers(ref self: TState, new_quorum: u32, signers_to_add: Span<ContractAddress>);
    fn remove_signers(ref self: TState, new_quorum: u32, signers_to_remove: Span<ContractAddress>);
    fn replace_signer(
        ref self: TState, signer_to_remove: ContractAddress, signer_to_add: ContractAddress,
    );
    fn change_quorum(ref self: TState, new_quorum: u32);
    fn submit_transaction(
        ref self: TState,
        to: ContractAddress,
        selector: felt252,
        calldata: Span<felt252>,
        salt: felt252,
    ) -> TransactionID;
    fn submit_transaction_batch(
        ref self: TState, calls: Span<Call>, salt: felt252,
    ) -> TransactionID;
    fn confirm_transaction(ref self: TState, id: TransactionID);
    fn revoke_confirmation(ref self: TState, id: TransactionID);
    fn execute_transaction(
        ref self: TState,
        to: ContractAddress,
        selector: felt252,
        calldata: Span<felt252>,
        salt: felt252,
    );
    fn execute_transaction_batch(ref self: TState, calls: Span<Call>, salt: felt252);
}
