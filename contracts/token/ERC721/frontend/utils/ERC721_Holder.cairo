# ERC721's `safeTransferFrom` requires a means of differentiating between account and

# contract level; therefore, this ERC721 implementation requires that all contracts that
# support safe ERC721 transfers (both accounts and non-accounts) include the `is_account` 
# method. This method should return `0` since this contract is NOT an account.
