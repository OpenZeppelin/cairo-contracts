Decentralized protocols are in constant evolution from the moment they are publicly released.
Often, the initial team retains control of this evolution in the first stages, but eventually delegates it to a community of stakeholders.
The process by which this community makes decisions is called on-chain governance, and it has become a central component of decentralized protocols, fueling varied decisions such as parameter tweaking, smart contract upgrades, integrations with other protocols, treasury management, grants, etc.

The Contracts for Cairo library aims to build a modular system of governance components for users to easily integrate and customize in their contracts.

== Timelock Controller

The Timelock Controller provides a means of enforcing time delays on the execution of transactions. This is considered good practice regarding governance systems because it allows users the opportunity to exit the system if they disagree with a decision before it is executed.

NOTE: The Timelock contract itself executes transactions, not the user. The Timelock should, therefore, hold associated funds, ownership, and access control roles.

=== Operation lifecycle

Timelocked operations are identified by a unique id (their hash) and follow a specific `OperationState` lifecycle:

`Unset` → `Waiting` → `Ready` → `Done`

=== Timelock flow

==== Schedule

:schedule: xref:api/governance.adoc#ITimelock-schedule[schedule]
:get_timestamp: xref:api/governance.adoc#ITimelock-get_timestamp[get_timestamp]

When a proposer calls {schedule}, the `OperationState` moves from `Unset` to `Waiting`.
This starts a timer that must be greater than or equal to the minimum delay.
The timer expires at a timestamp accessible through {get_timestamp}.
Once the timer expires, the `OperationState` automatically moves to the `Ready` state.
At this point, it can be executed.

==== Execute

:execute: xref:api/governance.adoc#ITimelock-execute[execute]

By calling {execute}, an executor triggers the operation's underlying transactions and moves it to the `Done` state. If the operation has a predecessor, the predecessor's operation must be in the `Done` state for this transaction to succeed.

==== Cancel

:cancel: xref:api/governance.adoc#ITimelock-cancel[cancel]

The {cancel} function allows cancellers to cancel any pending operations.
This resets the operation to the `Unset` state.
It is therefore possible for a proposer to re-schedule an operation that has been cancelled.
In this case, the timer restarts when the operation is re-scheduled.

=== Roles

{timelock-component} leverages an {accesscontrol-component} setup that we need to understand in order to set up roles.

- `PROPOSER_ROLE` - in charge of queueing operations.

- `CANCELLER_ROLE` - may cancel scheduled operations.
During initialization, accounts granted with `PROPOSER_ROLE` will also be granted `CANCELLER_ROLE`.
Therefore, the initial proposers may also cancel operations after they are scheduled.

- `EXECUTOR_ROLE` - in charge of executing already available operations.

- `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE` - can grant and revoke the three previous roles.

CAUTION: The `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE` is a sensitive role that will be granted automatically to the timelock itself and optionally to a second account.
The latter case may be required to ease a contract's initial configuration; however, this role should promptly be renounced.

Furthermore, the timelock component supports the concept of open roles for the `EXECUTOR_ROLE`.
This allows anyone to execute an operation once it's in the `Ready` OperationState.
To enable the `EXECUTOR_ROLE` to be open, grant the zero address with the `EXECUTOR_ROLE`.

CAUTION: Be very careful with enabling open roles as _anyone_ can call the function.

=== Minimum delay

:get_min_delay: xref:api/governance.adoc#ITimelock-get_min_delay[get_min_delay]

The minimum delay of the timelock acts as a buffer from when a proposer schedules an operation to the earliest point at which an executor may execute that operation.
The idea is for users, should they disagree with a scheduled proposal, to have options such as exiting the system or making their case for cancellers to cancel the operation.

After initialization, the only way to change the timelock's minimum delay is to schedule it and execute it with the same flow as any other operation.

The minimum delay of a contract is accessible through {get_min_delay}.

=== Usage

Integrating the timelock into a contract requires integrating {timelock-component} as well as {src5-component} and {accesscontrol-component} as dependencies.
The contract's constructor should initialize the timelock which consists of setting the:

- Proposers and executors.
- Minimum delay between scheduling and executing an operation.
- Optional admin if additional configuration is required.

NOTE: The optional admin should renounce their role once configuration is complete.

== Votes

The {votes-component} provides a flexible system for tracking and delegating voting power. This system allows users to delegate their voting power to other addresses, enabling more active participation in governance.

NOTE: By default, token balance does not account for voting power. This makes transfers cheaper. The downside is that it requires users to delegate to themselves in order to activate checkpoints and have their voting power tracked.

IMPORTANT: The transferring of voting units must be handled by the implementing contract. In the case of `ERC20` and `ERC721` this is usually done via the hooks. You can check the {votes-usage} section for examples of how to implement this.

=== Key Features

1. *Delegation*: Users can delegate their voting power to any address, including themselves. Vote power can be delegated either by calling the {delegate} function directly, or by providing a signature to be used with {delegate_by_sig}.
2. *Historical lookups*: The system keeps track of historical snapshots for each account, which allows the voting power of an account to be queried at a specific timestamp. +
This can be used for example to determine the voting power of an account when a proposal was created, rather than using the current balance.

=== Usage

When integrating the `VotesComponent`, the {voting_units_trait} must be implemented to get the voting units for a given account as a function of the implementing contract. +
For simplicity, this module already provides two implementations for `ERC20` and `ERC721` tokens, which will work out of the box if the respective components are integrated. +
Additionally, you must implement the {nonces-component} and the {snip12-metadata} trait to enable delegation by signatures.
