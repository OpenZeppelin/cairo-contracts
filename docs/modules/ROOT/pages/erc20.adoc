The ERC20 token standard is a specification for {fungible-tokens}, a type of token where all the units are exactly equal to each other.
`token::erc20::ERC20Component` provides an approximation of {eip20} in Cairo for Starknet.

WARNING: Prior to {version}, ERC20 contracts store and read `decimals` from storage; however, this implementation returns a static `18`.
If upgrading an older ERC20 contract that has a decimals value other than `18`, the upgraded contract *must* use a custom `decimals` implementation.
See the {custom-decimals} guide.

== Interface

:dual-interfaces: xref:/interfaces.adoc#dual_interfaces[Dual interfaces]

:erc20-component: xref:/api/erc20.adoc#ERC20Component[ERC20Component]
:erc20-supply: xref:/guides/erc20-supply.adoc[Creating ERC20 Supply]

The following interface represents the full ABI of the Contracts for Cairo {erc20-component}.
The interface includes the {ierc20-interface} standard interface as well as the optional {ierc20metadata-interface}.

To support older token deployments, as mentioned in {dual-interfaces}, the component also includes an implementation of the interface written in camelCase.

=== ERC20 compatibility

:cairo-selectors: https://github.com/starkware-libs/cairo/blob/7dd34f6c57b7baf5cd5a30c15e00af39cb26f7e1/crates/cairo-lang-starknet/src/contract.rs#L39-L48[Cairo]
:solidity-selectors: https://solidity-by-example.org/function-selector/[Solidity]
:dual-interface: xref:/interfaces.adoc#dual_interfaces[dual interface]

Although Starknet is not EVM compatible, this component aims to be as close as possible to the ERC20 token standard.
Some notable differences, however, can still be found, such as:

* The `ByteArray` type is used to represent strings in Cairo.
* The component offers a {dual-interface} which supports both snake_case and camelCase methods, as opposed to just camelCase in Solidity.
* `transfer`, `transfer_from` and `approve` will never return anything different from `true` because they will revert on any error.
* Function selectors are calculated differently between {cairo-selectors} and {solidity-selectors}.

== Usage

:erc20-supply: xref:/guides/erc20-supply.adoc[Creating ERC20 Supply]

Using Contracts for Cairo, constructing an ERC20 contract requires setting up the constructor and instantiating the token implementation.
Here's what that looks like:

[,cairo]
----
#[starknet::contract]
mod MyToken {
    use openzeppelin::token::erc20::{ERC20Component, ERC20HooksEmptyImpl};
    use starknet::ContractAddress;

    component!(path: ERC20Component, storage: erc20, event: ERC20Event);

    // ERC20 Mixin
    #[abi(embed_v0)]
    impl ERC20MixinImpl = ERC20Component::ERC20MixinImpl<ContractState>;
    impl ERC20InternalImpl = ERC20Component::InternalImpl<ContractState>;

    #[storage]
    struct Storage {
        #[substorage(v0)]
        erc20: ERC20Component::Storage
    }

    #[event]
    #[derive(Drop, starknet::Event)]
    enum Event {
        #[flat]
        ERC20Event: ERC20Component::Event
    }

    #[constructor]
    fn constructor(
        ref self: ContractState,
        initial_supply: u256,
        recipient: ContractAddress
    ) {
        let name = "MyToken";
        let symbol = "MTK";

        self.erc20.initializer(name, symbol);
        self.erc20._mint(recipient, initial_supply);
    }
}
----

`MyToken` integrates both the `ERC20Impl` and `ERC20MetadataImpl` with the embed directive which marks the implementations as external in the contract.
While the `ERC20MetadataImpl` is optional, it's generally recommended to include it because the vast majority of ERC20 tokens provide the metadata methods.
The above example also includes the `ERC20InternalImpl` instance.
This allows the contract's constructor to initialize the contract and create an initial supply of tokens.

TIP: For a more complete guide on ERC20 token mechanisms, see {erc20-supply}.

=== Customizing decimals

:floating-point: https://en.wikipedia.org//wiki/Floating-point_arithmetic[floating-point numbers]
:eip-discussion: https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/724[EIP discussion]

Cairo, like Solidity, does not support {floating-point}.
To get around this limitation, ERC20 token contracts may offer a `decimals` field which communicates to outside interfaces (wallets, exchanges, etc.) how the token should be displayed.
For instance, suppose a token had a `decimals` value of `3` and the total token supply was `1234`.
An outside interface would display the token supply as `1.234`.
In the actual contract, however, the supply would still be the integer `1234`.
In other words, *the decimals field in no way changes the actual arithmetic* because all operations are still performed on integers.

Most contracts use `18` decimals and this was even proposed to be compulsory (see the {eip-discussion}).
The Contracts for Cairo `ERC20` component includes a `decimals` function that returns `18` by default to save on gas fees.
For those who want an ERC20 token with a configurable number of decimals, the following guide shows two ways to achieve this.

NOTE: Both approaches require creating a custom implementation of the `IERC20Metadata` interface.

==== The static approach

The simplest way to customize `decimals` consists of returning the target value from the `decimals` method.
For example:

[,cairo]
----
#[external(v0)]
impl ERC20MetadataImpl of interface::IERC20Metadata<ContractState> {
    fn decimals(self: @ContractState) -> u8 {
        // Change the `3` below to the desired number of decimals
        3
    }

    (...)
}

----

==== The storage approach

For more complex scenarios, such as a factory deploying multiple tokens with differing values for decimals, a flexible solution might be appropriate.

TIP: Note that we are not using the MixinImpl in this case, since we need to customize the IERC20Metadata implementation.

[,cairo]
----
#[starknet::contract]
mod MyToken {
    use openzeppelin::token::erc20::{ERC20Component, ERC20HooksEmptyImpl};
    use starknet::ContractAddress;

    component!(path: ERC20Component, storage: erc20, event: ERC20Event);

    #[abi(embed_v0)]
    impl ERC20Impl = ERC20Component::ERC20Impl<ContractState>;
    #[abi(embed_v0)]
    impl ERC20CamelOnlyImpl = ERC20Component::ERC20CamelOnlyImpl<ContractState>;
    impl ERC20InternalImpl = ERC20Component::InternalImpl<ContractState>;

    #[storage]
    struct Storage {
        #[substorage(v0)]
        erc20: ERC20Component::Storage,
        // The decimals value is stored locally
        decimals: u8
    }

    #[event]
    #[derive(Drop, starknet::Event)]
    enum Event {
        #[flat]
        ERC20Event: ERC20Component::Event
    }

    #[constructor]
    fn constructor(
        ref self: ContractState,
        decimals: u8,
        initial_supply: u256,
        recipient: ContractAddress,
    ) {
        // Call the internal function that writes decimals to storage
        self._set_decimals(decimals);

        // Initialize ERC20
        let name = "MyToken";
        let symbol = "MTK";

        self.erc20.initializer(name, symbol);
        self.erc20._mint(recipient, initial_supply);
    }

    #[external(v0)]
    impl ERC20MetadataImpl of interface::IERC20Metadata<ContractState> {
        fn name(self: @ContractState) -> ByteArray {
            self.erc20.name()
        }

        fn symbol(self: @ContractState) -> ByteArray {
            self.erc20.symbol()
        }

        fn decimals(self: @ContractState) -> u8 {
            self.decimals.read()
        }
    }

    #[generate_trait]
    impl InternalImpl of InternalTrait {
        fn _set_decimals(ref self: ContractState, decimals: u8) {
            self.decimals.write(decimals);
        }
    }
}
----

This contract expects a `decimals` argument in the constructor and uses an internal function to write the decimals to storage.
Note that the `decimals` state variable must be defined in the contract's storage because this variable does not exist in the component offered by OpenZeppelin Contracts for Cairo.
It's important to include a custom ERC20 metadata implementation and NOT use the Contracts for Cairo `ERC20MetadataImpl` in this specific case since the `decimals` method will always return `18`.
