## Access Control

> **NOTE:** This document is better viewed at [https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts-cairo/0.18.0/api/access](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts-cairo/0.18.0/api/access)

This crate provides ways to restrict who can access the functions of a contract or when they can do it.

- `Ownable` is a simple mechanism with a single "owner" role that can be assigned to a single contract (usually an
account). This mechanism can be useful in simple scenarios, but fine grained access needs are likely to outgrow it.

- `AccessControl` provides a general role based access control mechanism. Multiple hierarchical roles can be created
and assigned each to multiple accounts.
