# OpenZeppelin Contracts for Cairo

[![Lint and test](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/cairo-contracts/actions/workflows/test.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/cairo-contracts/actions/workflows/test.yml)

**A library for secure smart contract development** written in Cairo for [Starknet](https://starkware.co/product/starknet/), a decentralized ZK Rollup.

> [!TIP]
> :mage: **Not sure how to get started?** Check out [Contracts Wizard for Cairo](https://wizard.openzeppelin.com/cairo) â€” an interactive smart contract generator.

## Usage

> [!WARNING]
> This repo contains highly experimental code.
> It hasn't been audited.
> **Use at your own risk.**

### Prepare the environment

Simply [install Cairo and scarb](https://docs.swmansion.com/scarb/download).

### Set up your project

Create a new project and `cd` into it.

```bash
scarb new my_project && cd my_project
```

The contents of `my_project` should look like this:

```bash
$ ls

Scarb.toml src
```

### Install the library

Edit `scarb.toml` and add:

```toml
[dependencies]
openzeppelin = "0.20.0"
```

The previous example would import the entire library. We can also add each package as a separate dependency to improve the building time by not including modules that won't be used:

```toml
[dependencies]
openzeppelin_token = "0.20.0"
```

Build the project to download it:

```bash
$ scarb build

Updating git repository https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/cairo-contracts
Compiling my_project v0.1.0 (~/my_project/Scarb.toml)
Finished release target(s) in 6 seconds
```

### Using the library

Open `src/lib.cairo` and write your contract.

For example, this is how to write an ERC20-compliant contract:

```cairo
#[starknet::contract]
mod MyToken {
    use openzeppelin_token::erc20::{ERC20Component, ERC20HooksEmptyImpl};
    use starknet::ContractAddress;

    component!(path: ERC20Component, storage: erc20, event: ERC20Event);

    // ERC20 Mixin
    #[abi(embed_v0)]
    impl ERC20MixinImpl = ERC20Component::ERC20MixinImpl<ContractState>;
    impl ERC20InternalImpl = ERC20Component::InternalImpl<ContractState>;

    #[storage]
    struct Storage {
        #[substorage(v0)]
        erc20: ERC20Component::Storage
    }

    #[event]
    #[derive(Drop, starknet::Event)]
    enum Event {
        #[flat]
        ERC20Event: ERC20Component::Event
    }

    #[constructor]
    fn constructor(
        ref self: ContractState,
        initial_supply: u256,
        recipient: ContractAddress
    ) {
        let name = "MyToken";
        let symbol = "MTK";

        self.erc20.initializer(name, symbol);
        self.erc20.mint(recipient, initial_supply);
    }
}
```
