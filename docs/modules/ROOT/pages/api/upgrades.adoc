= Upgrades

This crate provides interfaces and utilities related to upgradeability.

== Core

[.contract]
[[IUpgradeable]]
=== `++IUpgradeable++` link:https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/cairo-contracts/blob/release-v0.20.0/packages/upgrades/src/interface.cairo[{github-icon},role=heading-link]

:Upgraded: xref:UpgradeableComponent-Upgraded[Upgraded]

```cairo
use openzeppelin_upgrades::interface::IUpgradeable;
```

Interface of an upgradeable contract.

[#IUpgradeable-Functions]
==== Functions

[.contract-item]
[[IUpgradeable-upgrade]]
==== `[.contract-item-name]#++upgrade++#++(new_class_hash: ClassHash)++` [.item-kind]#external#

Upgrades the contract code by updating its {class_hash}.

NOTE: This function is usually protected by an xref:access.adoc[Access Control] mechanism.

[.contract]
[[IUpgradeAndCall]]
=== `++IUpgradeAndCall++` link:https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/cairo-contracts/blob/release-v0.20.0/packages/upgrades/src/interface.cairo[{github-icon},role=heading-link]

:Upgraded: xref:UpgradeableComponent-Upgraded[Upgraded]

```cairo
use openzeppelin::upgrades::interface::IUpgradeAndCall;
```

Interface for an upgradeable contract that couples an upgrade with a function call in the upgraded context.

[#IUpgradeAndCall-Functions]
==== Functions

[.contract-item]
[[IUpgradeAndCall-upgrade_and_call]]
==== `[.contract-item-name]#++upgrade_and_call++#++(new_class_hash: ClassHash, selector: felt252, calldata: Span<felt252>) → Span<felt252>++` [.item-kind]#external#

Upgrades the contract code by updating its {class_hash} and calls `selector` with the upgraded context.

NOTE: This function is usually protected by an xref:access.adoc[Access Control] mechanism.

[.contract]
[[UpgradeableComponent]]
=== `++UpgradeableComponent++` link:https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/cairo-contracts/blob/release-v0.20.0/packages/upgrades/src/upgradeable.cairo[{github-icon},role=heading-link]

```cairo
use openzeppelin_upgrades::upgradeable::UpgradeableComponent;
```

Upgradeable component.

[#UpgradeableComponent-Internal-Functions]
==== Internal Functions

:snip6: https://github.com/starknet-io/SNIPs/blob/main/SNIPS/snip-6.md[SNIP-6]

[.contract-item]
[[UpgradeableComponent-upgrade]]
==== `[.contract-item-name]#++upgrade++#++(ref self: ContractState, new_class_hash: ClassHash)++` [.item-kind]#internal#

Upgrades the contract by updating the contract {class_hash}.

Requirements:

- `new_class_hash` must be different from zero.

Emits an {Upgraded} event.

[.contract-item]
[[UpgradeableComponent-upgrade_and_call]]
==== `[.contract-item-name]#++upgrade_and_call++#++(ref self: ContractState, new_class_hash: ClassHash, selector: felt252, calldata: Span<felt252>) → Span<felt252>++` [.item-kind]#internal#

Replaces the contract's class hash with `new_class_hash` and then calls `selector`
from the upgraded context.
This function returns the unwrapped `call_contract_syscall` return value(s), if available, of the `selector` call.

Requirements:

- `new_class_hash` must be different from zero.

NOTE: The function call comes from the upgraded contract itself and not the account.

NOTE: A similar behavior to `upgrade_and_call` can also be achieved with a list of calls from an account since the {snip6} account standard supports multicall.
An account can execute a list of calls with xref:IUpgradeable-upgrade[upgrade] being the first element in the list and the extra function call as the second.
With this approach, the calls will execute from the account's context and can't be front-ran.

Emits an {Upgraded} event.

[#UpgradeableComponent-Events]
==== Events

[.contract-item]
[[UpgradeableComponent-Upgraded]]
==== `[.contract-item-name]#++Upgraded++#++(class_hash: ClassHash)++` [.item-kind]#event#

Emitted when the {class_hash} is upgraded.
