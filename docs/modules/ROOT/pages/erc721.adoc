The ERC721 token standard is a specification for {token-types}, or more colloquially: NFTs.
`token::erc721::ERC721Component` provides an approximation of {eip721} in Cairo for Starknet.

== Interface

:compatibility: xref:/erc721.adoc#erc721_compatibility[ERC721 Compatibility]
:ierc721-interface: xref:/api/erc721.adoc#IERC721[IERC721]
:ierc721metadata-interface: xref:/api/erc721.adoc#IERC721Metadata[IERC721Metadata]
:erc721-component: xref:/api/erc721.adoc#ERC721Component[ERC721Component]
:dual-interfaces: xref:interfaces.adoc#dual_interfaces[Dual interfaces]

The following interface represents the full ABI of the Contracts for Cairo {erc721-component}.
The interface includes the {ierc721-interface} standard interface and the optional {ierc721metadata-interface} interface.

To support older token deployments, as mentioned in {dual-interfaces}, the component also includes implementations of the interface written in camelCase.

=== ERC721 compatibility

:erc165-storage: https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/api/utils#ERC165Storage[ERC165Storage]
:src5-api: xref:introspection.adoc#src5[SRC5]
:introspection: xref:introspection.adoc[Introspection]
:eip165: https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-165[EIP165]

Although Starknet is not EVM compatible, this implementation aims to be as close as possible to the ERC721 standard.
This implementation does, however, include a few notable differences such as:

* ``interface_id``s are hardcoded and initialized by the constructor.
The hardcoded values derive from Starknet's selector calculations.
See the {introspection} docs.
* `safe_transfer_from` can only be expressed as a single function in Cairo as opposed to the two functions declared in EIP721, because function overloading is currently not possible in Cairo.
The difference between both functions consists of accepting `data` as an argument.
`safe_transfer_from` by default accepts the `data` argument which is interpreted as `Span<felt252>`.
If `data` is not used, simply pass an empty array.
* ERC721 utilizes {src5-api} to declare and query interface support on Starknet as opposed to Ethereum's {eip165}.
The design for `SRC5` is similar to OpenZeppelin's {erc165-storage}.
* `IERC721Receiver` compliant contracts return a hardcoded interface ID according to Starknet selectors (as opposed to selector calculation in Solidity).

== Usage

:mint-api: xref:api/erc721.adoc#ERC721-_mint[_mint]

Using Contracts for Cairo, constructing an ERC721 contract requires integrating both `ERC721Component` and `SRC5Component`.
The contract should also set up the constructor to initialize the token's name, symbol, and interface support.
Here's an example of a basic contract:

[,javascript]
----
#[starknet::contract]
mod MyNFT {
    use openzeppelin::introspection::src5::SRC5Component;
    use openzeppelin::token::erc721::ERC721Component;
    use starknet::ContractAddress;

    component!(path: ERC721Component, storage: erc721, event: ERC721Event);
    component!(path: SRC5Component, storage: src5, event: SRC5Event);

    // ERC721
    #[abi(embed_v0)]
    impl ERC721Impl = ERC721Component::ERC721Impl<ContractState>;
    #[abi(embed_v0)]
    impl ERC721MetadataImpl = ERC721Component::ERC721MetadataImpl<ContractState>;
    #[abi(embed_v0)]
    impl ERC721CamelOnly = ERC721Component::ERC721CamelOnlyImpl<ContractState>;
    #[abi(embed_v0)]
    impl ERC721MetadataCamelOnly =
        ERC721Component::ERC721MetadataCamelOnlyImpl<ContractState>;
    impl ERC721InternalImpl = ERC721Component::InternalImpl<ContractState>;

    // SRC5
    #[abi(embed_v0)]
    impl SRC5Impl = SRC5Component::SRC5Impl<ContractState>;

    #[storage]
    struct Storage {
        #[substorage(v0)]
        erc721: ERC721Component::Storage,
        #[substorage(v0)]
        src5: SRC5Component::Storage
    }

    #[event]
    #[derive(Drop, starknet::Event)]
    enum Event {
        #[flat]
        ERC721Event: ERC721Component::Event,
        #[flat]
        SRC5Event: SRC5Component::Event
    }

    #[constructor]
    fn constructor(
        ref self: ContractState,
        recipient: ContractAddress
    ) {
        let name = "MyNFT";
        let symbol = "NFT";
        let base_uri = "https://api.example.com/v1/";
        let token_id = 1;

        self.erc721.initializer(name, symbol, base_uri);
        self._mint(recipient, token_id);
    }
}

=== Token transfers

:transfer_from-api: xref:api/erc721.adoc#IERC721-transfer_from[transfer_from]
:safe_transfer_from-api: xref:api/erc721.adoc#IERC721-safe_transfer_from[safe_transfer_from]

This library includes {transfer_from-api} and {safe_transfer_from-api} to transfer NFTs.
If using `transfer_from`, *the caller is responsible to confirm that the recipient is capable of receiving NFTs or else they may be permanently lost.*
The `safe_transfer_from` method mitigates this risk by querying the recipient contract's interface support.

WARNING: Usage of `safe_transfer_from` prevents loss, though the caller must understand this adds an external call which potentially creates a reentrancy vulnerability.

=== Receiving tokens

:src5: xref:introspection.adoc#src5[SRC5]
:on_erc721_received-api: xref:api/erc721.adoc#IERC721Receiver-on_erc721_received[on_erc721_received]
:computing-interface-id: xref:introspection.adoc#computing_the_interface_id[Computing the interface ID]
:safe_transfer_from-api: xref:api/erc721.adoc#IERC721-safe_transfer_from[safe_transfer_from]
:safe_mint-api: xref:api/erc721.adoc#ERC721-_safe_mint[_safe_mint]

In order to be sure a non-account contract can safely accept ERC721 tokens, said contract must implement the `IERC721Receiver` interface.
The recipient contract must also implement the {src5} interface which, as described earlier, supports interface introspection.

==== IERC721Receiver

:receiver-id: xref:/api/erc721.adoc#IERC721Receiver[IERC721Receiver interface ID]

[,javascript]
----
trait IERC721Receiver {
    fn on_erc721_received(
        operator: ContractAddress,
        from: ContractAddress,
        token_id: u256,
        data: Span<felt252>
    ) -> felt252;
}
----

Implementing the `IERC721Receiver` interface exposes the {on_erc721_received-api} method.
When safe methods such as {safe_transfer_from-api} and {safe_mint-api} are called, they invoke the recipient contract's `on_erc721_received` method which *must* return the {receiver-id}.
Otherwise, the transaction will fail.

TIP: For information on how to calculate interface IDs, see {computing-interface-id}.

==== Creating a token receiver contract

The Contracts for Cairo `IERC721ReceiverImpl` already returns the correct interface ID for safe token transfers.
To integrate the `IERC721Receiver` interface into a contract, simply include the ABI embed directive to the implementation and add the `initializer` in the contract's constructor.
Here's an example of a simple token receiver contract:

[,javascript]
----
#[starknet::contract]
mod MyTokenReceiver {
    use openzeppelin::introspection::src5::SRC5Component;
    use openzeppelin::token::erc721::ERC721ReceiverComponent;
    use starknet::ContractAddress;

    component!(path: ERC721ReceiverComponent, storage: erc721_receiver, event: ERC721ReceiverEvent);
    component!(path: SRC5Component, storage: src5, event: SRC5Event);

    // ERC721Receiver
    #[abi(embed_v0)]
    impl ERC721ReceiverImpl = ERC721ReceiverComponent::ERC721ReceiverImpl<ContractState>;
    #[abi(embed_v0)]
    impl ERC721ReceiverCamelImpl = ERC721ReceiverComponent::ERC721ReceiverCamelImpl<ContractState>;
    impl ERC721ReceiverInternalImpl = ERC721ReceiverComponent::InternalImpl<ContractState>;

    // SRC5
    #[abi(embed_v0)]
    impl SRC5Impl = SRC5Component::SRC5Impl<ContractState>;

    #[storage]
    struct Storage {
        #[substorage(v0)]
        erc721_receiver: ERC721ReceiverComponent::Storage,
        #[substorage(v0)]
        src5: SRC5Component::Storage
    }

    #[event]
    #[derive(Drop, starknet::Event)]
    enum Event {
        #[flat]
        ERC721ReceiverEvent: ERC721ReceiverComponent::Event,
        #[flat]
        SRC5Event: SRC5Component::Event
    }

    #[constructor]
    fn constructor(ref self: ContractState) {
        self.erc721_receiver.initializer();
    }
}

=== Storing ERC721 URIs

:solidity-impl: https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/932fddf69a699a9a80fd2396fd1a2ab91cdda123/contracts/token/ERC721/ERC721.sol#L85-L93[Solidity implementation]
:token-uri: xref:/api/erc721.adoc#IERC721Metadata-token_uri[token_uri]

Token URIs were previously stored as single field elements prior to Cairo v0.2.5.
ERC721Component now stores only the base URI as a `ByteArray` and the full token URI is returned as the `ByteArray` concatenation of the base URI and the token ID through the {token-uri} method.
This design mirrors OpenZeppelin's default {solidity-impl} for ERC721.
