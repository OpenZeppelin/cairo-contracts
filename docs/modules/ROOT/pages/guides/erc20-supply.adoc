= Creating ERC20 Supply

:eip-20: https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-20[EIP20]

The standard interface implemented by tokens built on Starknet comes from the popular token standard on Ethereum called ERC20.
{eip-20}, from which ERC20 contracts are derived, does not specify how tokens are created.
This guide will go over strategies for creating both a fixed and dynamic token supply.

== Fixed Supply

Let's say we want to create a token named `MyToken` with a fixed token supply.
We can achieve this by setting the token supply in the constructor which will execute upon deployment.

[,javascript]
----
#[starknet::contract]
mod MyToken {
    use starknet::ContractAddress;
    use openzeppelin::token::erc20::ERC20;

    #[storage]
    struct Storage {}

    #[constructor]
    fn constructor(
        self: @ContractState,
        initial_supply: u256,
        recipient: ContractAddress
    ) {
        let name = 'MyToken';
        let symbol = 'MTK';

        let mut unsafe_state = ERC20::unsafe_new_contract_state();
        ERC20::InternalImpl::initializer(ref unsafe_state, name, symbol);
        ERC20::InternalImpl::_mint(ref unsafe_state, recipient, initial_supply);
    }
}
----

In the constructor, we're first grabbing the ERC20 state and calling the ERC20 initializer to set the token name and symbol.
Next, we're calling the internal `_mint` function which creates `initial_supply` of tokens and allocates them to `recipient`.
Since the internal `_mint` is not exposed in our contract, it will not be possible to create any more tokens.
In other words, we've implemented a fixed token supply!

== Dynamic Supply

:access-control: xref:/access.adoc[Access Control]

ERC20 contracts with a dynamic supply include a mechanism for creating or destroying tokens.
Let's make a few changes to the almighty `MyToken` contract and create a minting mechanism.

[,javascript]
----
#[starknet::contract]
mod MyToken {
    use starknet::ContractAddress;
    use openzeppelin::token::erc20::ERC20;

    #[storage]
    struct Storage {}

    #[constructor]
    fn constructor(self: @ContractState) {
        let name = 'MyToken';
        let symbol = 'MTK';

        let mut unsafe_state = ERC20::unsafe_new_contract_state();
        ERC20::InternalImpl::initializer(ref unsafe_state, name, symbol);
    }

    #[external(v0)]
    fn mint(
        self: @ContractState,
        recipient: ContractAddress,
        amount: u256
    ) {
        // This function is NOT protected which means
        // ANYONE can mint tokens
        let mut unsafe_state = ERC20::unsafe_new_contract_state();
        ERC20::InternalImpl::_mint(ref unsafe_state, recipient, amount);
    }
}
----

The exposed `mint` above will create `amount` tokens and allocate them to `recipient`.
We now have our minting mechanism!

There is, however, a big problem.
`mint` does not include any restrictions on who can call this function.
For the sake of good practices, let's implement a simple permissioning mechanism with `Ownable`.

[,javascript]
----
#[starknet::contract]
mod MyToken {
    use starknet::ContractAddress;
    use openzeppelin::access::ownable::Ownable;
    use openzeppelin::token::erc20::ERC20;

    #[storage]
    struct Storage {}

    #[constructor]
    fn constructor(self: @ContractState, owner: ContractAddress) {
        // Set contract owner
        let mut unsafe_ownable = Ownable::unsafe_new_contract_state();
        Ownable::InternalImpl::initializer(ref unsafe_ownable, owner);
    
        // Initialize ERC20
        let name = 'MyToken';
        let symbol = 'MTK';

        let mut unsafe_erc20 = ERC20::unsafe_new_contract_state();
        ERC20::InternalImpl::initializer(ref unsafe_erc20, name, symbol);
    }

    #[external(v0)]
    fn mint(
        self: @ContractState,
        recipient: ContractAddress,
        amount: u256
    ) {
        // Set permissions with Ownable
        let unsafe_ownable = Ownable::unsafe_new_contract_state();
        Ownable::InternalImpl::assert_only_owner(@unsafe_ownable);

        // Mint tokens if called by the contract owner
        let mut unsafe_erc20 = ERC20::unsafe_new_contract_state();
        ERC20::InternalImpl::_mint(ref unsafe_erc20, recipient, amount);
    }
}
----

In the constructor, we pass the owner address to set the owner of the `MyToken` contract.
The `mint` function includes `assert_only_owner` which will ensure that only the contract owner can call this function.
Now, we have a protected ERC20 minting mechanism to create a dynamic token supply.
