= Counterfactual deployments

A counterfactual contract is a contract we can interact with even before actually deploying it on-chain.
For example, we can send funds or assign privileges to a contract that doesn't yet exist.
Why? Because deployments in Starknet are deterministic, allowing us to predict the address where our contract will be deployed.
We can leverage this property to make a contract pay for its own deployment by simply sending funds in advance. We call this a counterfactual deployment.

This process can be described with the following steps:

TIP: For testing this flow you can check the {foundry} or the {starkli} guides for deploying accounts.

1. Deterministically precompute the `contract_address` given a `class_hash`, `salt`, and constructor `calldata`.
Note that the `class_hash` must be previously declared for the deployment to succeed.

2. Send funds to the `contract_address`. Usually you will estimate the fee of the transaction first. Existing
tools usually do this for you.

3. Send a `DeployAccount` type transaction to the network.

4. The protocol will then validate the transaction with the `\\__validate_deploy__` entrypoint of the contract to be deployed.

5. If the validation succeeds, the protocol will charge the fee and then register the contract as deployed.

NOTE: Although this method is very popular to deploy accounts, this works for any kind of contract.

== Deployment validation

To be counterfactually deployed, the deploying contract must implement the `\\__validate_deploy__` entrypoint,
called by the protocol when a `DeployAccount` transaction is sent to the network.
