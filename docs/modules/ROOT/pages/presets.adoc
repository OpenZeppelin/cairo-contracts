To understand the compiled class hash term, check {cairo-and-sierra}.

TIP: {starkli} class-hash command can be used to compute the class hash from a compiled artifact.

TIP: To obtain the artifact
using {scarb}, set the `casm = true` option under `\[[target.starknet-contract]]` in the `Scarb.toml` file.
