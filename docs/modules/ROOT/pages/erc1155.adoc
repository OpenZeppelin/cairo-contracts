= ERC1155

The ERC1155 multi token standard is a specification for {fungibility-agnostic} token contracts.
The ERC1155 library implements an approximation of {eip-1155} in Cairo for StarkNet.

== Multi Token Standard

:balance_of-api: xref:api/erc1155.adoc#IERC1155-balance_of[balance_of]
:erc721-balance_of-api: xref:api/erc721.adoc#IERC721-balance_of[balance_of]

The distinctive feature of ERC1155 is that it uses a single smart contract to represent multiple tokens at once. This
is why its {balance_of-api} function differs from ERC20’s and ERC777’s: it has an additional ID argument for the
identifier of the token that you want to query the balance of.

This is similar to how ERC721 does things, but in that standard a token ID has no concept of balance: each token is
non-fungible and exists or doesn’t. The ERC721 {erc721-balance_of-api} function refers to how many different tokens an account
has, not how many of each. On the other hand, in ERC1155 accounts have a distinct balance for each token ID, and
non-fungible tokens are implemented by simply minting a single one of them.

This approach leads to massive gas savings for projects that require multiple tokens. Instead of deploying a new
contract for each token type, a single ERC1155 token contract can hold the entire system state, reducing deployment
costs and complexity.

== Interface

:compatibility: xref:/erc1155.adoc#erc1155_compatibility[ERC1155 Compatibility]
:isrc5-interface: xref:/api/introspection.adoc#ISRC5[ISRC5]
:ierc1155-interface: xref:/api/erc1155.adoc#IERC1155[IERC1155]
:ierc1155metadata-interface: xref:/api/erc1155.adoc#IERC1155MetadataURI[IERC1155MetadataURI]
:erc1155-component: xref:/api/erc1155.adoc#ERC1155Component[ERC1155Component]
:dual-interfaces: xref:interfaces.adoc#dual_interfaces[Dual interfaces]

The following interface represents the full ABI of the Contracts for Cairo {erc1155-component}.
The interface includes the {ierc1155-interface} standard interface and the optional {ierc1155metadata-interface} interface together with {isrc5-interface}.

To support older token deployments, as mentioned in {dual-interfaces}, the component also includes implementations of the interface written in camelCase.

=== ERC1155 Compatibility

Although Starknet is not EVM compatible, this implementation aims to be as close as possible to the ERC1155 standard but some differences can still be found, such as:

* The optional `data` argument in both `safe_transfer_from` and `safe_batch_transfer_from` is implemented as `Span<felt252>`.
* `IERC1155Receiver` compliant contracts must implement SRC5 and register the `IERC1155Receiver` interface ID.
* `IERC1155Receiver::on_erc1155_received` must return that interface ID on success.

== Usage

Using Contracts for Cairo, constructing an ERC1155 contract requires integrating both `ERC1155Component` and `SRC5Component`.
The contract should also set up the constructor to initialize the token's URI and interface support.
Here's an example of a basic contract:

[,cairo]
----
#[starknet::contract]
mod MyERC1155 {
    use openzeppelin::introspection::src5::SRC5Component;
    use openzeppelin::token::erc1155::{ERC1155Component, ERC1155HooksEmptyImpl};
    use starknet::ContractAddress;

    component!(path: ERC1155Component, storage: erc1155, event: ERC1155Event);
    component!(path: SRC5Component, storage: src5, event: SRC5Event);

    // ERC1155 Mixin
    #[abi(embed_v0)]
    impl ERC1155MixinImpl = ERC1155Component::ERC1155MixinImpl<ContractState>;
    impl ERC1155InternalImpl = ERC1155Component::InternalImpl<ContractState>;

    #[storage]
    struct Storage {
        #[substorage(v0)]
        erc1155: ERC1155Component::Storage,
        #[substorage(v0)]
        src5: SRC5Component::Storage
    }

    #[event]
    #[derive(Drop, starknet::Event)]
    enum Event {
        #[flat]
        ERC1155Event: ERC1155Component::Event,
        #[flat]
        SRC5Event: SRC5Component::Event
    }

    #[constructor]
    fn constructor(
        ref self: ContractState,
        token_uri: ByteArray,
        recipient: ContractAddress,
        token_ids: Span<u256>,
        values: Span<u256>
    ) {
        self.erc1155.initializer(token_uri);
        self
            .erc1155
            .batch_mint_with_acceptance_check(recipient, token_ids, values, array![].span());
    }
}
----

=== Batch operations

:safe_transfer_from: xref:/api/erc1155.adoc#IERC1155-safe_transfer_from[safe_transfer_from]
:balance_of_batch: xref:/api/erc1155.adoc#IERC1155-balance_of_batch[balance_of_batch]
:safe_batch_transfer_from: xref:/api/erc1155.adoc#IERC1155-safe_batch_transfer_from[safe_batch_transfer_from]
:batch_mint_with_acceptance_check: xref:/api/erc1155.adoc#ERC1155Component-batch_mint_with_acceptance_check[batch_mint_with_acceptance_check]

Because all state is held in a single contract, it is possible to operate over multiple tokens in a single transaction very efficiently. The standard provides two functions, {balance_of_batch} and {safe_batch_transfer_from}, that make querying multiple balances and transferring multiple tokens simpler and less gas-intensive. We also have {safe_transfer_from} for non-batch operations.

In the spirit of the standard, we’ve also included batch operations in the non-standard functions, such as
{batch_mint_with_acceptance_check}.

WARNING: While {safe_transfer_from} and {safe_batch_transfer_from} prevent loss by checking the receiver can handle the
tokens, this yields execution to the receiver which can result in a xref:security.adoc#reentrancy_guard[reentrant call].

=== Receiving tokens

:src5: xref:introspection.adoc#src5[SRC5]
:on_erc1155_received: xref:/api/erc1155.adoc#IERC1155Receiver-on_erc1155_received[on_erc1155_received]
:on_erc1155_batch_received: xref:/api/erc1155.adoc#IERC1155Receiver-on_erc1155_batch_received[on_erc1155_batch_received]
:computing-interface-id: xref:introspection.adoc#computing_the_interface_id[Computing the interface ID]

In order to be sure a non-account contract can safely accept ERC1155 tokens, said contract must implement the `IERC1155Receiver` interface.
The recipient contract must also implement the {src5} interface which supports interface introspection.

==== IERC1155Receiver

:receiver-id: xref:/api/erc1155.adoc#IERC1155Receiver[IERC1155Receiver interface ID]

[,cairo]
----
trait IERC1155Receiver {
    fn on_erc1155_received(
        operator: ContractAddress,
        from: ContractAddress,
        token_id: u256,
        value: u256,
        data: Span<felt252>
    ) -> felt252;
    fn on_erc1155_batch_received(
        operator: ContractAddress,
        from: ContractAddress,
        token_ids: Span<u256>,
        values: Span<u256>,
        data: Span<felt252>
    ) -> felt252;
}
----

Implementing the `IERC1155Receiver` interface exposes the {on_erc1155_received} and {on_erc1155_batch_received} methods.
When {safe_transfer_from} and {safe_batch_transfer_from} are called, they invoke the recipient contract's `on_erc1155_received` or `on_erc1155_batch_received` methods respectively which *must* return the {receiver-id}.
Otherwise, the transaction will fail.

TIP: For information on how to calculate interface IDs, see {computing-interface-id}.

==== Creating a token receiver contract

:ERC1155ReceiverComponent: xref:/api/erc1155.adoc#ERC1155ReceiverComponent[ERC1155ReceiverComponent]

The Contracts for Cairo {ERC1155ReceiverComponent} already returns the correct interface ID for safe token transfers.
To integrate the `IERC1155Receiver` interface into a contract, simply include the ABI embed directive to the implementations and add the `initializer` in the contract's constructor.
Here's an example of a simple token receiver contract:

[,cairo]
----
#[starknet::contract]
mod MyTokenReceiver {
    use openzeppelin::introspection::src5::SRC5Component;
    use openzeppelin::token::erc1155::ERC1155ReceiverComponent;
    use starknet::ContractAddress;

    component!(path: ERC1155ReceiverComponent, storage: erc1155_receiver, event: ERC1155ReceiverEvent);
    component!(path: SRC5Component, storage: src5, event: SRC5Event);

    // ERC1155Receiver Mixin
    #[abi(embed_v0)]
    impl ERC1155ReceiverMixinImpl = ERC1155ReceiverComponent::ERC1155ReceiverMixinImpl<ContractState>;
    impl ERC1155ReceiverInternalImpl = ERC1155ReceiverComponent::InternalImpl<ContractState>;

    #[storage]
    struct Storage {
        #[substorage(v0)]
        erc1155_receiver: ERC1155ReceiverComponent::Storage,
        #[substorage(v0)]
        src5: SRC5Component::Storage
    }

    #[event]
    #[derive(Drop, starknet::Event)]
    enum Event {
        #[flat]
        ERC1155ReceiverEvent: ERC1155ReceiverComponent::Event,
        #[flat]
        SRC5Event: SRC5Component::Event
    }

    #[constructor]
    fn constructor(ref self: ContractState) {
        self.erc1155_receiver.initializer();
    }
}
