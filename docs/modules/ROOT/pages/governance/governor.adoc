Decentralized protocols are in constant evolution from the moment they are publicly released. Often,
the initial team retains control of this evolution in the first stages, but eventually delegates it
to a community of stakeholders. The process by which this community makes decisions is called
on-chain governance, and it has become a central component of decentralized protocols, fueling
varied decisions such as parameter tweaking, smart contract upgrades, integrations with other
protocols, treasury management, grants, etc.

This governance protocol is generally implemented in a special-purpose contract called “Governor”. In
OpenZeppelin Contracts for Cairo, we set out to build a modular system of Governor components where different
requirements can be accommodated by implementing specific traits. You will find the most common requirements out of the box,
but writing additional ones is simple, and we will be adding new features as requested by the community in future releases.

== Usage and setup

=== Token

The voting power of each account in our governance setup will be determined by an ERC20 or an ERC721 token. The token has
to implement the {votes-component} extension. This extension will keep track of historical balances so that voting power
is retrieved from past snapshots rather than current balance, which is an important protection that prevents double voting.

If your project already has a live token that does not include Votes and is not upgradeable, you can wrap it in a
governance token by using a wrapper. This will allow token holders to participate in governance by wrapping their tokens 1-to-1.

NOTE: The library currently does not include a wrapper for tokens, but it will be added in a future release.

NOTE: Currently, the clock mode is fixed to block timestamps, since the Votes component uses the block timestamp to track
checkpoints. We plan to add support for more flexible clock modes in Votes in a future release, allowing to use, for example,
block numbers instead.

=== Governor

We will initially build a Governor without a timelock. The core logic is given by the {governor-component}, but we
still need to choose:

1) how voting power is determined,

2) how many votes are needed for quorum,

3) what options people have when casting a vote and how those votes are counted, and

4) the execution mechanism that should be used.

Each of these aspects is customizable by writing your own extensions,
or more easily choosing one from the library.

:GovernorVotes: xref:api/governance.adoc#GovernorVotesComponent[GovernorVotes]
:GovernorVotesQuorumFraction: xref:api/governance.adoc#GovernorVotesQuorumFractionComponent[GovernorVotesQuorumFraction]
:GovernorCountingSimple: xref:api/governance.adoc#GovernorCountingSimpleComponent[GovernorCountingSimple]
:GovernorCoreExecution: xref:api/governance.adoc#GovernorCoreExecutionComponent[GovernorCoreExecution]
:GovernorSettings: xref:api/governance.adoc#GovernorSettingsComponent[GovernorSettings]
:GovernorTimelockExecution: xref:api/governance.adoc#GovernorTimelockExecutionComponent[GovernorTimelockExecution]
:GovernorSettingsTrait: xref:api/governance.adoc#GovernorComponent[GovernorSettingsTrait]

**For 1)** we will use the {GovernorVotes} extension, which hooks to an {ivotes} instance to determine the voting power
of an account based on the token balance they hold when a proposal becomes active.
This module requires the address of the token to be passed as an argument to the initializer.

**For 2)** we will use {GovernorVotesQuorumFraction}. This works together with the {ivotes} instance to define the quorum as a
percentage of the total supply at the block when a proposal’s voting power is retrieved. This requires an initializer
parameter to set the percentage besides the votes token address. Most Governors nowadays use 4%. Since the quorum denominator
is 1000 for precision, we initialize the module with a numerator of 40, resulting in a 4% quorum (40/1000 = 0.04 or 4%).

**For 3)** we will use {GovernorCountingSimple}, an extension that offers 3 options to voters: For, Against, and Abstain,
and where only For and Abstain votes are counted towards quorum.

**For 4)** we will use {GovernorCoreExecution}, an extension that allows proposal execution directly through the governor.

NOTE: Another option is {GovernorTimelockExecution}. An example can be found in the next section.

Besides these, we also need an implementation for the {GovernorSettingsTrait} defining the voting delay, voting period,
and proposal threshold. While we can use the {GovernorSettings} extension which allows to set these parameters by the
governor itself, we will implement the trait locally in the contract and set the voting delay, voting period,
and proposal threshold as constant values.

__voting_delay__: How long after a proposal is created should voting power be fixed. A large voting delay gives
users time to unstake tokens if necessary.

__voting_period__: How long does a proposal remain open to votes.

NOTE: These parameters are specified in the unit defined in the token’s clock, which is for now always timestamps.

__proposal_threshold__: This restricts proposal creation to accounts who have enough voting power.

An implementation of `GovernorComponent::ImmutableConfig` is also required. For the example below, we have used
the `DefaultConfig`. Check the {immutable-config} guide for more details.

The last missing step is to add an `SNIP12Metadata` implementation used to retrieve the name and version of the governor.

=== Timelock

It is good practice to add a timelock to governance decisions. This allows users to exit the system if they disagree
with a decision before it is executed. We will use OpenZeppelin’s {timelock-controller} in combination with the
GovernorTimelockExecution extension.

IMPORTANT: When using a timelock, it is the timelock that will execute proposals and thus the timelock that should
hold any funds, ownership, and access control roles.

TimelockController uses an {access-control} setup that we need to understand in order to set up roles.

The Proposer role is in charge of queueing operations: this is the role the Governor instance must be granted,
and it MUST be the only proposer (and canceller) in the system.

The Executor role is in charge of executing already available operations: we can assign this role to the special
zero address to allow anyone to execute (if operations can be particularly time sensitive, the Governor should be made Executor instead).

The Canceller role is in charge of canceling operations: the Governor instance must be granted this role,
and it MUST be the only canceller in the system.

Lastly, there is the Admin role, which can grant and revoke the two previous roles: this is a very sensitive role that will be granted automatically to the timelock itself, and optionally to a second account, which can be used for ease of setup but should promptly renounce the role.

The following example uses the GovernorTimelockExecution extension, together with GovernorSettings, and uses a
fixed quorum value instead of a percentage:
