= Interfaces and Dispatchers

This section describes the interfaces OpenZeppelin Contracts for Cairo offer, and explains the design choices behind them.

Interfaces can be found in the module tree under the `interface` submodule, such as `token::erc20::interface`. For example:

```cairo
use openzeppelin::token::erc20::interface::IERC20;
```

or

```cairo
use openzeppelin::token::erc20::dual20::DualCaseERC20;
```

NOTE: For simplicity, we'll use ERC20 as example but the same concepts apply to other modules.

== Interface traits
The library offers three types of traits to implement or interact with contracts:

=== Standard traits

These are associated with a predefined interface such as a standard.
This includes only the functions defined in the interface, and is the standard way to interact with a compliant contract.

```cairo
#[starknet::interface]
trait IERC20<TState> {
    fn total_supply(self: @TState) -> u256;
    fn balance_of(self: @TState, account: ContractAddress) -> u256;
    fn allowance(self: @TState, owner: ContractAddress, spender: ContractAddress) -> u256;
    fn transfer(ref self: TState, recipient: ContractAddress, amount: u256) -> bool;
    fn transfer_from(
        ref self: TState, sender: ContractAddress, recipient: ContractAddress, amount: u256
    ) -> bool;
    fn approve(ref self: TState, spender: ContractAddress, amount: u256) -> bool;
}
```

=== ABI traits

They describe a contract's complete interface. This is useful to interface with a preset contract offered by this library, such as the ERC20 preset that includes functions from different traits such as `IERC20` and `IERC20Camel`.

```cairo
#[starknet::interface]
trait ERC20ABI<TState> {
    // IERC20
    fn total_supply(self: @TState) -> u256;
    fn balance_of(self: @TState, account: ContractAddress) -> u256;
    fn allowance(self: @TState, owner: ContractAddress, spender: ContractAddress) -> u256;
    fn transfer(ref self: TState, recipient: ContractAddress, amount: u256) -> bool;
    fn transfer_from(
        ref self: TState, sender: ContractAddress, recipient: ContractAddress, amount: u256
    ) -> bool;
    fn approve(ref self: TState, spender: ContractAddress, amount: u256) -> bool;

    // IERC20Metadata
    fn name(self: @TState) -> ByteArray;
    fn symbol(self: @TState) -> ByteArray;
    fn decimals(self: @TState) -> u8;

    // IERC20CamelOnly
    fn totalSupply(self: @TState) -> u256;
    fn balanceOf(self: @TState, account: ContractAddress) -> u256;
    fn transferFrom(
        ref self: TState, sender: ContractAddress, recipient: ContractAddress, amount: u256
    ) -> bool;
}
```

=== Dispatcher traits
This is a utility trait to interface with contracts whose interface is unknown. Read more in the xref:#dualcase_dispatchers[DualCase Dispatchers] section.

```cairo
#[derive(Copy, Drop)]
struct DualCaseERC20 {
    contract_address: ContractAddress
}

trait DualCaseERC20Trait {
    fn name(self: @DualCaseERC20) -> ByteArray;
    fn symbol(self: @DualCaseERC20) -> ByteArray;
    fn decimals(self: @DualCaseERC20) -> u8;
    fn total_supply(self: @DualCaseERC20) -> u256;
    fn balance_of(self: @DualCaseERC20, account: ContractAddress) -> u256;
    fn allowance(self: @DualCaseERC20, owner: ContractAddress, spender: ContractAddress) -> u256;
    fn transfer(self: @DualCaseERC20, recipient: ContractAddress, amount: u256) -> bool;
    fn transfer_from(
        self: @DualCaseERC20, sender: ContractAddress, recipient: ContractAddress, amount: u256
    ) -> bool;
    fn approve(self: @DualCaseERC20, spender: ContractAddress, amount: u256) -> bool;
}
```

== Dual interfaces

Following the {great-interface-migration} plan, we added `snake_case` functions to all of our preexisting `camelCase` contracts with the goal of eventually dropping support for the latter.

In short, we offer two types of interfaces and utilities to handle them:

1. `camelCase` interfaces, which are the ones we've been using so far.
2. `snake_case` interfaces, which are the ones we're migrating to.

This means that currently most of our contracts implement _dual interfaces_. For example, the ERC20 preset contract exposes `transferFrom`, `transfer_from`, `balanceOf`, `balance_of`, etc.

NOTE: Dual interfaces are available for all external functions present in previous versions of OpenZeppelin Contracts for Cairo (https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/cairo-contracts/releases/tag/v0.6.1[v0.6.1] and below).

=== `IERC20`

The default version of the ERC20 interface trait exposes `snake_case` functions:

```cairo
#[starknet::interface]
trait IERC20<TState> {
    fn name(self: @TState) -> ByteArray;
    fn symbol(self: @TState) -> ByteArray;
    fn decimals(self: @TState) -> u8;
    fn total_supply(self: @TState) -> u256;
    fn balance_of(self: @TState, account: ContractAddress) -> u256;
    fn allowance(self: @TState, owner: ContractAddress, spender: ContractAddress) -> u256;
    fn transfer(ref self: TState, recipient: ContractAddress, amount: u256) -> bool;
    fn transfer_from(
        ref self: TState, sender: ContractAddress, recipient: ContractAddress, amount: u256
    ) -> bool;
    fn approve(ref self: TState, spender: ContractAddress, amount: u256) -> bool;
}
```

=== `IERC20Camel`

On top of that, we also offer a `camelCase` version of the same interface:

```cairo
#[starknet::interface]
trait IERC20Camel<TState> {
    fn name(self: @TState) -> ByteArray;
    fn symbol(self: @TState) -> ByteArray;
    fn decimals(self: @TState) -> u8;
    fn totalSupply(self: @TState) -> u256;
    fn balanceOf(self: @TState, account: ContractAddress) -> u256;
    fn allowance(self: @TState, owner: ContractAddress, spender: ContractAddress) -> u256;
    fn transfer(ref self: TState, recipient: ContractAddress, amount: u256) -> bool;
    fn transferFrom(
        ref self: TState, sender: ContractAddress, recipient: ContractAddress, amount: u256
    ) -> bool;
    fn approve(ref self: TState, spender: ContractAddress, amount: u256) -> bool;
}
```

== `DualCase` dispatchers

WARNING: `DualCase` dispatchers won't work on live chains (`mainnet` or testnets) until they implement panic handling in their runtime. Dispatchers work fine in testing environments.

In order to ease this transition, OpenZeppelin Contracts for Cairo offer what we call `DualCase` dispatchers such as `DualCaseERC721` or `DualCaseAccount`.

These modules wrap a target contract with a compatibility layer to expose a `snake_case` interface no matter what casing the underlying contract uses.
This way, an AMM wouldn't have problems integrating tokens independently of their interface.

For example:

```cairo
let token = DualCaseERC20 { contract_address: target };
token.transfer_from(OWNER(), RECIPIENT(), VALUE);
```

This is done by simply executing the `snake_case` version of the function (e.g. `transfer_from`) and falling back to the `camelCase` one (e.g. `transferFrom`) in case it reverts with `ENTRYPOINT_NOT_FOUND`, like this:

```cairo
fn try_selector_with_fallback(
    target: ContractAddress, selector: felt252, fallback: felt252, args: Span<felt252>
) -> SyscallResult<Span<felt252>> {
    match call_contract_syscall(target, selector, args) {
        Result::Ok(ret) => Result::Ok(ret),
        Result::Err(errors) => {
            if *errors.at(0) == 'ENTRYPOINT_NOT_FOUND' {
                return call_contract_syscall(target, fallback, args);
            } else {
                Result::Err(errors)
            }
        }
    }
}
```

Trying the `snake_case` interface first renders `camelCase` calls a bit more expensive since a failed `snake_case` call will always happen before. This is a design choice to incentivize casing adoption/transition as per the {great-interface-migration}.
