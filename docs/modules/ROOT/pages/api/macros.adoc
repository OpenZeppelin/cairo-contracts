= Macros

This crate provides a collection of macros that streamline and simplify development with the library.
To use them, you need to add the `openzeppelin_macros` crate as a dependency to your `Scarb.toml` file:

```toml
[dependencies]
openzeppelin_macros = "0.20.0"
```

== Attribute macros

[.contract]
[[with_components]]
=== `++with_components++`

This macro simplifies the syntax for adding a set of components to a contract.
