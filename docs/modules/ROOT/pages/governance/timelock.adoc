= Timelock Controller

:timelock-component: xref:api/governance.adoc#TimelockControllerComponent[TimelockControllerComponent]
:accesscontrol-component: xref:api/access.adoc#AccessControlComponent[AccessControlComponent]
:src5-component: xref:api/introspection.adoc#SRC5Component[SRC5Component]

The Timelock Controller provides a means of enforcing time delays on the execution of transactions. This is considered good practice regarding governance systems because it allows users the opportunity to exit the system if they disagree with a decision before it is executed.

NOTE: The Timelock contract itself executes transactions, not the user. The Timelock should, therefore, hold associated funds, ownership, and access control roles.

== Operation lifecycle

The state of an operation is represented by the `OperationState` enum and can be retrieved 
by calling the `get_operation_state` function with the operation's identifier.

The identifier of an operation is a `felt252` value, computed as the Pedersen hash of the 
operation's call or calls, its predecessor, and salt. It can be computed by invoking the 
implementing contract's `hash_operation` function for single-call operations or 
`hash_operation_batch` for multi-call operations. Submitting an operation with identical calls, 
predecessor, and the same salt value a second time will fail, as operation identifiers must be 
unique. To resolve this, use a different salt value to generate a unique identifier.

Timelocked operations follow a specific lifecycle:

`Unset` → `Waiting` → `Ready` → `Done`

- `Unset`: the operation has not been scheduled or has been canceled.
- `Waiting`: the operation has been scheduled and is pending the scheduled delay.
- `Ready`: the timer has expired, and the operation is eligible for execution.
- `Done`: the operation has been executed.

== Timelock flow

=== Schedule

:schedule: xref:api/governance.adoc#ITimelock-schedule[schedule]
:get_timestamp: xref:api/governance.adoc#ITimelock-get_timestamp[get_timestamp]

When a proposer calls {schedule}, the `OperationState` moves from `Unset` to `Waiting`.
This starts a timer that must be greater than or equal to the minimum delay.
The timer expires at a timestamp accessible through {get_timestamp}.
Once the timer expires, the `OperationState` automatically moves to the `Ready` state.
At this point, it can be executed.

=== Execute

:execute: xref:api/governance.adoc#ITimelock-execute[execute]

By calling {execute}, an executor triggers the operation's underlying transactions and moves it to the `Done` state. If the operation has a predecessor, the predecessor's operation must be in the `Done` state for this transaction to succeed.

=== Cancel

:cancel: xref:api/governance.adoc#ITimelock-cancel[cancel]

The {cancel} function allows cancellers to cancel any pending operations.
This resets the operation to the `Unset` state.
It is therefore possible for a proposer to re-schedule an operation that has been cancelled.
In this case, the timer restarts when the operation is re-scheduled.

=== Roles

{timelock-component} leverages an {accesscontrol-component} setup that we need to understand in order to set up roles.

- `PROPOSER_ROLE` - in charge of queueing operations.

- `CANCELLER_ROLE` - may cancel scheduled operations.
During initialization, accounts granted with `PROPOSER_ROLE` will also be granted `CANCELLER_ROLE`.
Therefore, the initial proposers may also cancel operations after they are scheduled.

- `EXECUTOR_ROLE` - in charge of executing already available operations.

- `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE` - can grant and revoke the three previous roles.

CAUTION: The `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE` is a sensitive role that will be granted automatically to the timelock itself and optionally to a second account.
The latter case may be required to ease a contract's initial configuration; however, this role should promptly be renounced.

Furthermore, the timelock component supports the concept of open roles for the `EXECUTOR_ROLE`.
This allows anyone to execute an operation once it's in the `Ready` OperationState.
To enable the `EXECUTOR_ROLE` to be open, grant the zero address with the `EXECUTOR_ROLE`.

CAUTION: Be very careful with enabling open roles as _anyone_ can call the function.

=== Minimum delay

:get_min_delay: xref:api/governance.adoc#ITimelock-get_min_delay[get_min_delay]

The minimum delay of the timelock acts as a buffer from when a proposer schedules an operation to the earliest point at which an executor may execute that operation.
The idea is for users, should they disagree with a scheduled proposal, to have options such as exiting the system or making their case for cancellers to cancel the operation.

After initialization, the only way to change the timelock's minimum delay is to schedule it and execute it with the same flow as any other operation.

The minimum delay of a contract is accessible through {get_min_delay}.

=== Usage

Integrating the timelock into a contract requires integrating {timelock-component} as well as {src5-component} and {accesscontrol-component} as dependencies.
The contract's constructor should initialize the timelock which consists of setting the:

- Proposers and executors.
- Minimum delay between scheduling and executing an operation.
- Optional admin if additional configuration is required.

NOTE: The optional admin should renounce their role once configuration is complete.

Here's an example of a simple timelock contract:
