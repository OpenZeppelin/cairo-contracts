## Presets

> **NOTE:** This document is better viewed at https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts-cairo/presets

Presets are ready-to-deploy contracts provided by the library. Since presets are intended to be very simple and as
generic as possible, thereâ€™s no support for custom or complex contracts such as `ERC20Pausable` or `ERC721Mintable`.

For contract customization and combination of modules you can use
[Wizard for Cairo](https://wizard.openzeppelin.com/cairo), our code-generation tool.

### Presets

- `AccountUpgradeable`
- `ERC20Upgradeable`
- `ERC721Upgradeable`
- `ERC1155Upgradeable`
- `EthAccountUpgradeable`
- `UniversalDeployer`
