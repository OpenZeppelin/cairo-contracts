= Accounts

Unlike Ethereum where accounts are derived from a private key, all Starknet accounts are contracts. This means there's no Externally Owned Account (EOA)
concept on Starknet.

Instead, the network features native account abstraction and signature validation happens at the contract level.

For a general overview of account abstraction, see
https://docs.starknet.io/documentation/architecture_and_concepts/Accounts/introduction/[Starknet's documentation].
A more detailed discussion on the topic can be found in
https://community.starknet.io/t/starknet-account-abstraction-model-part-1/781[Starknet Shaman's forum].

TIP: For detailed information on the usage and implementation check the xref:/api/account.adoc[API Reference] section.

== Standard Account Interface

Accounts in Starknet are smart contracts, and so they can be deployed and interacted
with like any other contract, and can be extended to implement any custom logic. However, an account is a special type
of contract that is used to validate and execute transactions. For this reason, it must implement a set of entrypoints
that the protocol uses for this execution flow. The {snip-6}[SNIP-6] proposal defines a standard interface for accounts,
supporting this execution flow and interoperability with DApps in the ecosystem.

=== ISRC6 Interface

[,cairo]
----
/// Represents a call to a target contract function.
struct Call {
    to: ContractAddress,
    selector: felt252,
    calldata: Array<felt252>
}

/// Standard Account Interface
trait ISRC6 {
    /// Executes a transaction through the account.
    fn __execute__(calls: Array<Call>) -> Array<Span<felt252>>;

    /// Asserts whether the transaction is valid to be executed.
    fn __validate__(calls: Array<Call>) -> felt252;

    /// Asserts whether a given signature for a given hash is valid.
    fn is_valid_signature(hash: felt252, signature: Array<felt252>) -> felt252;
}
----

{snip-6}[SNIP-6] adds the `is_valid_signature` method. This method is not used by the protocol, but it's useful for
DApps to verify the validity of signatures, supporting features like Sign In with Starknet.

SNIP-6 also defines that compliant accounts must implement the SRC5 interface following {snip-5}[SNIP-5], as
a mechanism for detecting whether a contract is an account or not through introspection.

=== ISRC5 Interface

[,cairo]
----
/// Standard Interface Detection
trait ISRC5 {
    /// Queries if a contract implements a given interface.
    fn supports_interface(interface_id: felt252) -> bool;
}
----

{snip-6}[SNIP-6] compliant accounts must return `true` when queried for the ISRC6 interface Id.

Even though these interfaces are not enforced by the protocol, it's recommended to implement them for enabling
interoperability with the ecosystem.

== Protocol-level methods

In this section we will describe the methods that the protocol uses for abstracting the accounts. The first two
are required for enabling accounts to be used for executing transactions. The rest are optional:

1. `\\__validate__` verifies the validity of the transaction to be executed. This is usually used to validate signatures,
but the entrypoint implementation can be customized to feature any validation mechanism https://docs.starknet.io/documentation/architecture_and_concepts/Accounts/validate_and_execute/#validate_limitations[with some limitations].

2. `\\__execute__` executes the transaction if the validation is successful.

3. `\\__validate_declare__` optional entrypoint similar to `\\__validate__` but for transactions
meant to declare other contracts.

4. `\\__validate_deploy__` optional entrypoint similar to `\\__validate__` but meant for {counterfactual}.

NOTE: Although these entrypoints are available to the protocol for its regular transaction flow, they can also be called like any other method.

== Deploying an account

In Starknet there are two ways of deploying smart contracts: using the `deploy_syscall` and doing
counterfactual deployments.
The former can be easily done with the xref:udc.adoc[Universal Deployer Contract (UDC)], a contract that
wraps and exposes the `deploy_syscall` to provide arbitrary deployments through regular contract calls.
But if you don't have an account to invoke it, you will probably want to use the latter.

To do counterfactual deployments, you need to implement another protocol-level entrypoint named
`\\__validate_deploy__`. Check the {counterfactual} guide to learn how.

== Sending transactions

Contracts for Cairo offers two flavors of components to use for creating accounts: `AccountComponent` and `EthAccountComponent`.
Though the ISRC6 interface is agnostic regarding validation schemes, both available components utilize public-private key pairs that control the account.
The public key is set in the constructor.

Mixin implementations are available to use for both components which include basic account functionality as well as additional features such as the ability to:

- View and transfer the account's public key.
- Declare contract class hashes.
- Counterfactually deploy.

=== AccountComponent

:account-mixin: xref:/api/account.adoc#AccountComponent-Embeddable-Mixin-Impl[AccountMixin]
:initializer: xref:/api/account.adoc#AccountComponent-initializer[initializer]
:custom-account-setup: https://foundry-rs.github.io/starknet-foundry/starknet/account.html#custom-account-contract[custom account setup]
:sncast-version: https://github.com/foundry-rs/starknet-foundry/releases/tag/v0.23.0[v0.23.0]

To create an account, implement the {account-mixin} and set up the constructor to initialize the contract.
The {initializer} method sets the public key for the account contract and registers the account interface id.
A vanilla account contract looks like this:

```[,cairo]
#[starknet::contract(account)]
mod MyAccount {
    use openzeppelin::account::AccountComponent;
    use openzeppelin::introspection::src5::SRC5Component;

    component!(path: AccountComponent, storage: account, event: AccountEvent);
    component!(path: SRC5Component, storage: src5, event: SRC5Event);

    // Account Mixin
    #[abi(embed_v0)]
    impl AccountMixinImpl = AccountComponent::AccountMixinImpl<ContractState>;
    impl AccountInternalImpl = AccountComponent::InternalImpl<ContractState>;

    #[storage]
    struct Storage {
        #[substorage(v0)]
        account: AccountComponent::Storage,
        #[substorage(v0)]
        src5: SRC5Component::Storage
    }

    #[event]
    #[derive(Drop, starknet::Event)]
    enum Event {
        #[flat]
        AccountEvent: AccountComponent::Event,
        #[flat]
        SRC5Event: SRC5Component::Event
    }

    #[constructor]
    fn constructor(ref self: ContractState, public_key: felt252) {
        self.account.initializer(public_key);
    }
}
```

To deploy the Contracts for Cairo account variant, compile the contract and declare the class hash because custom accounts are likely not declared.
This means that you'll need an account already deployed.

Next, create the account JSON with Starknet Foundry's {custom-account-setup} and include the `--class-hash` flag with the declared class hash.
The flag enables custom account variants.

NOTE: The following examples use `sncast` {sncast-version}.

```[,bash]
$ sncast \
  --url http://127.0.0.1:5050 \
  account create \
  --name my-custom-account \
  --class-hash 0x123456...
```

This command will output the precomputed contract address and the recommended `max-fee`.
To counterfactually deploy the account, send funds to the address and then deploy the custom account.

```[,bash]
$ sncast \
  --url http://127.0.0.1:5050 \
  account deploy \
  --name my-custom-account
```

Once the account is deployed, set the `--account` flag with the custom account name to send transactions from that account.

```[,bash]
$ sncast \
  --account my-custom-account \
  --url http://127.0.0.1:5050 \
  invoke \
  --contract-address 0x123... \
  --function "some_function" \
  --calldata 1 2 3
```

=== EthAccountComponent

:eth-account-mixin: xref:/api/account.adoc#EthAccountComponent-Embeddable-Mixin-Impl[EthAccountMixin]
:eth-initializer: xref:/api/account.adoc#EthAccountComponent-initializer[initializer]
:starknetjs: https://www.starknetjs.com/[StarknetJS]
:starknetjs-commit: https://github.com/starknet-io/starknet.js/commit/d002baea0abc1de3ac6e87a671f3dec3757437b3[d002baea0abc1de3ac6e87a671f3dec3757437b3]

To create an Ethereum-flavored account, implement the {eth-account-mixin} and set up the constructor to initialize the contract.
Since this is an EthAccount, the {eth-initializer} expects the `EthPublicKey` type (alias for `Secp256k1Point`) to store as the account's public key.
The contract also requires the `Secp256K1Impl` implementation in order to serialize and deserialize the `EthPublicKey` type.
A basic Ethereum-flavored account contract looks like this:

```[,cairo]
#[starknet::contract(account)]
mod MyEthAccount {
    use openzeppelin::account::EthAccountComponent;
    use openzeppelin::account::interface::EthPublicKey;
    use openzeppelin::account::utils::secp256k1::Secp256k1PointSerde;
    use openzeppelin::introspection::src5::SRC5Component;

    component!(path: EthAccountComponent, storage: eth_account, event: EthAccountEvent);
    component!(path: SRC5Component, storage: src5, event: SRC5Event);

    // EthAccount Mixin
    #[abi(embed_v0)]
    impl EthAccountMixinImpl =
        EthAccountComponent::EthAccountMixinImpl<ContractState>;
    impl EthAccountInternalImpl = EthAccountComponent::InternalImpl<ContractState>;

    #[storage]
    struct Storage {
        #[substorage(v0)]
        eth_account: EthAccountComponent::Storage,
        #[substorage(v0)]
        src5: SRC5Component::Storage
    }

    #[event]
    #[derive(Drop, starknet::Event)]
    enum Event {
        #[flat]
        EthAccountEvent: EthAccountComponent::Event,
        #[flat]
        SRC5Event: SRC5Component::Event
    }

    #[constructor]
    fn constructor(ref self: ContractState, public_key: EthPublicKey) {
        self.eth_account.initializer(public_key);
    }
}
```

Special tooling is required in order to deploy and send transactions with an Ethereum-flavored account contract.
The following examples utilize the {starknetjs} library.

Compile and declare the contract on the target network.
Next, precompute the EthAccount contract address using the declared class hash.

NOTE: The following examples use unreleased features from StarknetJS (`starknetjs@next`) at commit {starknetjs-commit}.

```[,javascript]
import * as dotenv from 'dotenv';
import { CallData, EthSigner, hash } from 'starknet';
import { ABI as ETH_ABI } from '../abis/eth_account.js';
dotenv.config();

// Calculate EthAccount address
const ethSigner = new EthSigner(process.env.ETH_PRIVATE_KEY);
const ethPubKey = await ethSigner.getPubKey();
const ethAccountClassHash = '<ETH_ACCOUNT_CLASS_HASH>';
const ethCallData = new CallData(ETH_ABI);
const ethAccountConstructorCalldata = ethCallData.compile('constructor', {
    public_key: ethPubKey
})
const salt = '0x12345';
const deployerAddress = '0x0';
const ethContractAddress = hash.calculateContractAddressFromHash(
    salt,
    ethAccountClassHash,
    ethAccountConstructorCalldata,
    deployerAddress
);
console.log('Pre-calculated EthAccount address: ', ethContractAddress);
```

Send funds to the pre-calculated EthAccount address and deploy the contract.

```[,javascript]
import * as dotenv from 'dotenv';
import { Account, CallData, EthSigner, RpcProvider, stark } from 'starknet';
import { ABI as ETH_ABI } from '../abis/eth_account.js';
dotenv.config();

// Prepare EthAccount
const provider = new RpcProvider({ nodeUrl: process.env.API_URL });
const ethSigner = new EthSigner(process.env.ETH_PRIVATE_KEY);
const ethPubKey = await ethSigner.getPubKey();
const ethAccountAddress = '<ETH_ACCOUNT_ADDRESS>'
const ethAccount = new Account(provider, ethAccountAddress, ethSigner);

// Prepare payload
const ethAccountClassHash = '<ETH_ACCOUNT_CLASS_HASH>'
const ethCallData = new CallData(ETH_ABI);
const ethAccountConstructorCalldata = ethCallData.compile('constructor', {
    public_key: ethPubKey
})
const salt = '0x12345';
const deployPayload = {
    classHash: ethAccountClassHash,
    constructorCalldata: ethAccountConstructorCalldata,
    addressSalt: salt,
};

// Deploy
const { suggestedMaxFee: feeDeploy } = await ethAccount.estimateAccountDeployFee(deployPayload);
const { transaction_hash, contract_address } = await ethAccount.deployAccount(
    deployPayload,
    { maxFee: stark.estimatedFeeToMaxFee(feeDeploy, 100) }
);
await provider.waitForTransaction(transaction_hash);
console.log('EthAccount deployed at: ', contract_address);
```

Once deployed, connect the EthAccount instance to the target contract which enables calls to come from the EthAccount.
Here's what an ERC20 transfer from an EthAccount looks like.

```[,javascript]
import * as dotenv from 'dotenv';
import { Account, RpcProvider, Contract, EthSigner } from 'starknet';
dotenv.config();

// Prepare EthAccount
const provider = new RpcProvider({ nodeUrl: process.env.API_URL });
const ethSigner = new EthSigner(process.env.ETH_PRIVATE_KEY);
const ethAccountAddress = '<ETH_ACCOUNT_CONTRACT_ADDRESS>'
const ethAccount = new Account(provider, ethAccountAddress, ethSigner);

// Prepare target contract
const erc20 = new Contract(compiledErc20.abi, erc20Address, provider);

// Connect EthAccount with the target contract
erc20.connect(ethAccount);

// Execute ERC20 transfer
const transferCall = erc20.populate('transfer', {
    recipient: recipient.address,
    amount: 50n
});
const tx = await erc20.transfer(
    transferCall.calldata, { maxFee: 900_000_000_000_000 }
);
await provider.waitForTransaction(tx.transaction_hash);
```
