/// # ERC4626 Component
///
/// The ERC4626 component is an extension of ERC20 and provides an implementation of the IERC4626
/// interface which allows the minting and burning of "shares" in exchange for an underlying
/// "asset". The component leverages traits to configure fees, limits, and decimals.
///
/// CAUTION: In empty (or nearly empty) ERC-4626 vaults, deposits are at high risk of being stolen
/// through frontrunning with a "donation" to the vault that inflates the price of a share. This is
/// variously known as a donation or inflation attack and is essentially a problem of slippage.
/// Vault deployers can protect against this attack by making an initial deposit of a non-trivial
/// amount of the asset, such that price manipulation becomes infeasible. Withdrawals may similarly
/// be affected by slippage. Users can protect against this attack as well as unexpected slippage in
/// general by verifying the amount received is as expected, using a wrapper that performs these
/// checks.
///
/// This implementation offers configurable virtual assets and shares to help developers mitigate
/// that risk. `ImmutableConfig::DECIMALS_OFFSET` corresponds to an offset in the decimal
/// representation between the underlying asset's decimals and vault decimals. This offset also
/// determines the rate of virtual shares to virtual assets in the vault, which itself determines
/// the initial exchange rate. While not fully preventing the attack, analysis shows that the
/// default offset (0) makes it non-profitable even if an attacker is able to capture value from
/// multiple user deposits, as a result of the value being captured by the virtual shares (out of
/// the attacker's donation) matching the attacker's expected gains. With a larger offset, the
/// attack becomes orders of magnitude more expensive than it is profitable.
///
/// The drawback of this approach is that the virtual shares do capture (a very small) part of the
/// value being accrued to the vault. Also, if the vault experiences losses and users try to exit
/// the vault, the virtual shares and assets will cause the first exiting user to experience reduced
/// losses to the detriment to the last users who will experience bigger losses.
