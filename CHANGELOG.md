### Changed (Breaking)

## 0.14.0 (2024-06-14)

### Changed (Breaking)

- Migrated to the `2023_11` edition (#995):
  - Component implementations annotated with `#[embeddable_as()]` (e.g: `AccessControlComponent::AccessControl`) are not public anymore. Note that the embeddable versions are still public (e.g: `AccessControlComponent::AccessControlImpl`).
  - Implementations that can be compiler-derived from traits are not public anymore (e.g: `DualCaseAccessControlImpl` is not public while `DualCaseAccessControlTrait` is).
  - `Secp256k1PointPartialEq` and `DebugSecp256k1Point` are not public anymore.
  - `account::utils::execute_single_call` is not public anymore.
  - Presets are not public anymore, since they should be copied into projects, and not directly imported.
  - `Trace` and `Checkpoint` structs are not public anymore, since they are intended to be used in `ERC20Votes`, and not as generic utilities.
  - `StorageArray` is not public anymore, since this implementation is specific to `ERC20Votes`, and is not intended as a generic utility, but as a temporary solution until Starknet native implementation arrives.

- Apply underscore pattern to modules (#993):
  - AccessControlComponent
    - `_set_role_admin` function renamed to `set_role_admin`

    - `_pause` function renamed to `pause`

    - `_mint` function renamed to `mint`
    - `_burn` function renamed to `burn`
    - `_update` function renamed to `update`
  - ERC721Component:
    - `_safe_transfer` function renamed to `safe_transfer`
    - `_safe_mint` function renamed to `safe_mint`
    - `_mint` function renamed to `mint`
    - `_transfer` function renamed to `transfer`
    - `_burn` function renamed to `burn`
    - `_update` function renamed to `update`
